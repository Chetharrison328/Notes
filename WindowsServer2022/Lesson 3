#   Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
Module: Overview of AD DS | Workgroups vs Domains | Domain Controllers | User & Group   

---

##   What I Learned

- The difference between **Workgroups** and **Domains** (types of network models)
- Core concepts of **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**
- Logical and physical components of Active Directory
- Key AD objects: users, groups, computers
- How to install AD DS and promote a server to a domain controller
- How to create users and groups using Active Directory Users & Computers

---

##   Questions I Had

- When should I use an OU vs a security group?
- What are some real-world examples of forests vs domain trees?
- How is a Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) secured in a branch office setup?
- How do domain trusts work across forests?

---

##   How Things Connected

- **Workgroup vs Domain** helped explain why centralized identity is critical in enterprise environments.
- **Domain Controllers** tie into centralized authentication and **Group Policy**, forming the backbone of enterprise security.
- **Logical vs Physical components** helped me understand how design and infrastructure align.
- Installing AD DS made the abstract terms (like "forest" and "object") more practical and visible in real tools.
- Creating users and groups showed how **IAM starts at the OS-level** before scaling into cloud IAM tools like Entra ID.

##   What I Need to Try Next

- Build a mini lab to:
  - Create a new domain in VirtualBox/Hyper-V
  - Add multiple users and organize them into OUs and groups
  - Test permission delegation with Group Policy
- Document the forest/domain structure visually
- Practice with Read-Only Domain Controller setup
- Compare AD DS to Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) to see differences/similarities

##  Real-World Application / Use Case

- **Workgroups** are great for small businesses with <10 PCs, but **Domains** are required for scalable, secure enterprise setups.
- Every corporate environment uses **AD DS or Entra ID** to handle authentication, making this foundational for **IAM engineering**.
- Understanding **users, groups, and policies** in AD is a direct precursor to managing **cloud-based IAM tools**.
- **Domain Controllers** are a real-world example of centralized IAM systems that mirror how modern tools like Entra, Okta, and CyberArk work.
- These skills apply to IT support, sysadmin, security analyst, and IAM engineer roles.
